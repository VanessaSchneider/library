I’m thinking like a sixteen-hour bubble bath while dining on pastel pink macarons imported from Paris amount of self-care. 
    I’d been dating Brad for approximately nine months. I’d met his parents and he’d met mine, which is a phase 3 seriousness level indicator transitioning to phase 4. It was finally my turn, I was reaching that uncharted territory where it is essential to have presentable nails because popping the question is imminent, requiring hand/ring pictures. 
    He’d invited me to come to his family’s Christmas celebration, with his entire extended family. I was even learning all the little intricacies of being a member of his family. For instance, I’d been warned to avoid getting stuck alone with Uncle Ralph because he tends to talk about his marble collection for hours and when he hugs, he makes them last about two and a half seconds too long. The morning of the party, Brad was supposed to call me when it was time to come, and it would likely be around 3:00. 
    I am ready by 2:00 and just waiting for the call. The clock ticks to 3:15 and no call yet…no biggie, maybe the veggie tray is taking longer than expected to assemble. 
    At 3:30, I send a text and at 3:45 still no response. At 4:00, I finally call him with no answer, and I continue to call him in fifteen-minute increments until 5:00. I’m just sure there was an emergency, so I try to remain calm.
